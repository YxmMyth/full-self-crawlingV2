# Sites Directory

Site-specific knowledge and configuration files are stored here.

Structure:
```
sites/
├── {site_key}/
│   ├── knowledge.json     # Learned knowledge for this site
│   └── config.yaml        # Site-specific configuration
```

Note: Since Agent is disposable (用完即弃), knowledge.json is primarily
for Orchestrator analytics and historical reference, not for Agent runtime.
